# CFDPython

This repository is based on [12 Steps to Navier Stokes](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython) created by Professor [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/).

Here we build from solving 1D Linear Convection in [Step 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nicofraternali/CFDPython/blob/master/lessons/Step_1.ipynb) to [Step 11](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nicofraternali/CFDPython/blob/master/lessons/Step_11.ipynb) where we make a solver for the Navier-Stokes equation in 2D, particulary to model a lid-driven cavity.
